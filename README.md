Audio Waveform Pop-Up Cards
=========

Create a 3D pop-up card visualization for an audio file!

These pop-up card designs are programmatically generated by taking an audio file and sampling the audio amplitude over 
time graph. They measure 5"x7" (5" x 3.5" when folded). They fit in a [standard cammerical North American #10 
envelope](https://www.designersinsights.com/designer-resources/north-american-paper-envelope-sizes/) and can be mailed with a single U.S. forever stamp.


This project came about as a way for me to wish happy holidays to some geographically-faraway friends. The pattern in 
[samples/popup.svg](samples/popup.svg) is 
generated from an audio recording of me saying "happy holidays." They are inspired by [Peter Dahmen's Amazing Pop-Up card tutorial](https://peterdahmen.de/en/2017/09/07/amazing-pop-up-card-tutorial/) and by the art of [*kirigami*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirigami).

# How to make your own


## Tools Needed:

- A Paper Cutting Tool. Options:
  - A cutting machine (I used a [Silhouette Cameo 2](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/)) or
  - An X-Acto knife & cutting board
- Elmer's Glue
- Paintbrush (for glue)

## Materials

- 65 lb Cardstock paper (I used [Recollections brand from Michael's](https://www.michaels.com/recollections-cape-cod-cardstock-paper-8.5inx11in/10356412.html))
  - 1 sheet for the pop-up (pop-up sheet)
  - 1 sheet for card (what you will glue the pattern to) (card sheet)
  - These can be different colors
- Extra Cardstock because you will mess up
  
  
## How to generate a pop-up pattern
    brew install ffmpeg
    
    python popupgen.py --infile=<input audio file path> --outfile=<output file path>
    
    python popupgen.py --infile=samples/audio.m4a --outfile=output.pdf

* `infile` can be any audio file that [ffmpeg supports](http://www.ffmpeg.org/general.html#File-Formats) including 
wav, m4a, mp3, ogg, and wma.
* `outfile` can be a SVG or PDF

## How to assemble the card

1. Pre-work: Go through [Peter Dahmen's Amazing Pop-Up card tutorial](https://peterdahmen.de/en/2017/09/07/amazing-pop-up-card-tutorial/) so you understand how the paper pieces should be assembled.

1. Print out the pop-up pattern on the pop-up sheet and cut the red lines. [Mountain fold](http://www.origami-instructions.com/origami-valley-and-mountain-folds.html) the green lines. 
    - If you are using a Sihouette Cameo 2, I have screenshots of the settings I used in the [silhouettesettings](silhouettesettings) folder

1. Take the card sheet and cut a 5"x7" rectangle. Fold this sheet in half so that it is 5"x3.5" (some people call 
this hamburger style).

1. Apply a thin layer of glue on the pop-up cutout using the paintbrush. Glue the pop-up cut out and card cutout 
together the 
same way the 
the patterns are assembled in the pop-up card tutorial.

1. Optional: cut and glue [snowflake.svg](samples/snowflake.svg) for the front of the card

## Tips

- If you use different colors for the pop-up and card paper, then there will be a visible gap at the crease of 
the card. To cover this cut out a small rectangle in the pop-up sheet color and glue it over the gap.

- Do not tape the pop-up pattern together and then glue it to the card. There needs to be a gap. Otherwise, your 
card will wrinkle around the fold when you close it.

- Use glue sparingly. Too much glue will wrinkle the cardstock.
